Model outline:
- G2 symmetry functions: 6
- Distance cutoff: 8 Ã…
- Neural network architecture:
6 G2 -> linear -> 40 -> ReLU -> 40 -> ReLU -> 40 -> linear -> 1 


Training procedure:
1. Trained according to "ML-IMC-init-training.in".
2. Post-training starts from "6G2-narrow-wide-repulsion-rc-8/random-model-9/model-iter-04.bson" (iteration 4 of the main training)
according to "ML-IMC-init-posttraining.in".
3. The final model corresponds to "continuation-rc-8/random-model-11/model-iter-80.bson".
