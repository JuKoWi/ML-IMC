# MLCG potentials
***M**achine **L**earning derived **C**oarse-**G**rained potentials* is a **Python**-based tool to derive effective potentials for the coarse-grained molecular dynamics using a machine learning algorithm. 
During the training, the difference between the sampled radial distribution functions (RDFs) and the reference RDFs obtained at a higher resolution is minimized.
**LAMMPS** simulation package is used to sample intermediate RDFs during the optimization procedure.
