Model outline:
- G2 symmetry functions: 6
- Distance cutoff: 7 Ã…
- Neural network architecture:
6 G2 -> linear -> 40 -> ReLU -> 40 -> ReLU -> 40 -> linear -> 1 


Training procedure:
1. Trained according to "ML-IMC-init-training.in".
2. Post-training starts from "random-model-17/model-iter-03.bson" (iteration 3 of the main training)
according to "ML-IMC-init-posttraining.in".
3. The final model corresponds to "random-model-10/model-iter-30.bson".
