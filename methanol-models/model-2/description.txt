- Distance cutoff: 10 Ã…
- Neural network architecture:
24 G2 -> linear -> 40 -> ReLU -> 40 -> ReLU -> 40 -> linear -> 1 

Training procedure:
1. Run 1 input file: "ML-IMC-init-run-1.in".
2. Run 2 input file: "ML-IMC-init-run-2.in", starts from iteration 25
3. Run 3 input file: "ML-IMC-init-run-3.in", starts from iteration 20
4. The final model is taken after iteration 29 of the run 3
