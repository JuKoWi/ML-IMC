methanol-CG-NN.bson

Model outline:
- G2 symmetry functions: 8
- Distance cutoff: 10 Ã…
- Neural network architecture:
8 G2 -> linear -> 20 -> ReLU -> 20 -> ReLU -> 20 -> linear -> 1 

Training procedure:
1. Trained according to "ML-IMC-init-training.in".
2. Post-training starts from "methanol-NN-2/random-model-1/model-iter-10.bson" (iteration 10 of the main training)
according to "ML-IMC-init-posttraining.in".
3. The final model is taken after 15th iteration of the "model-4-posttraining"
