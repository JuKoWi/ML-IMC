Model outline:
- G2 symmetry functions: 9
- Distance cutoff: 7 Ã…
- Neural network architecture:
9 G2 -> linear -> 40 -> ReLU -> 40 -> ReLU -> 40 -> linear -> 1 

Training procedure:
1. Trained according to "ML-IMC-init-training.in".
2. Post-training starts from "9G2-eta-4.0/random-model-5/model-iter-03.bson" (iteration 3 of the main training)
according to "ML-IMC-init-posttraining.in".
3. The final model corresponds to "random-model-1/model-iter-79.bson".
